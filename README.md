# KF7032 – Big Data & Cloud Computing (2024–25)
### Combined Portfolio: Assessment 1 (Group Literature Review) & Assessment 2 (Big Data Product)

This repository summarises my academic work for the **KF7032 Big Data and Cloud Computing** module at Northumbria University. It includes both the **group literature review** (Assessment 1) and the **individual big data product** (Assessment 2). Together, these demonstrate my ability to analyse large datasets, apply distributed processing techniques, evaluate machine learning and statistical methods, and write academically rigorous reports.

# 📘 Assessment 1 – Literature Review on Crime & Big Data (Group Work, 25%)
*Based on: "ASSESSMENT 1.docx"* :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🔍 Overview
As part of a team, I helped produce a 2000-word academic report reviewing how **big data analytics and machine learning** are used to analyse **UK crime data**. The report explored:

- Patterns of violent crime  
- Firearm incidents and their causes  
- Links between deprivation and crime  
- Computational methods for analysing crime  
- Machine learning algorithms applied to crime prediction  
- Big data technologies used in public datasets  

The group was also required to conduct a **peer review** of another team’s work, evaluating the quality, structure, literature use, and relevance of their crime analysis report.

## 🧩 My Contributions
- Conducted literature searches on big data crime analytics  
- Summarised academic research relating to violent crime and data modelling  
- Wrote sections on machine learning approaches & statistical techniques  
- Ensured academic referencing and citation accuracy  
- Completed structured peer review of another group’s report  

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated
- Academic research & critical analysis  
- Understanding of statistical & ML crime analytics  
- Team collaboration  
- Reviewing & constructive feedback  
- Academic writing & IEEE/APA-style citation

# 📘 Assessment 2 – Big Data Product: Weapons, Drugs & Violent Crime (Individual Work, 75%)
*Based on: "ASSESSMENT 2 final.docx"* :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 🔍 Problem Overview
This assessment required building a full **big data analytics solution** to investigate three real-world claims made in a UK documentary:

1. **Violent crime is increasing**  
2. **Liverpool has the highest firearm incidents per capita**  
3. **Firearms offences are associated with drug offences**

Using multi-million-row **UK Home Office street-level crime data** and deprivation datasets, I developed an **Apache Spark–based solution** on cloud infrastructure.

## 🏗️ Technology Stack
- **Apache Spark** for distributed processing  
- **Python / PySpark** within **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Cloud Infrastructure (IaaS)** for scalable computation  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** for analysis & visualisation  
- **Big data filtering, transformation, and statistical modelling**  

## 🧠 Tasks Completed
- Provisioned Spark cluster on a cloud platform  
- Loaded and processed ~19 million crime records  
- Filtered for violent crimes, drug offences, and weapon possession cases  
- Analysed time trends to determine if violent crime is rising  
- Calculated firearm incidents per capita across UK cities  
- Investigated correlation between drug crime and weapons offences  
- Created up to four meaningful visualisations to support conclusions  
- Documented reasoning using Markdown inside the notebook  
- Evaluated the limitations, advantages, and challenges of the approach  

## 📊 Key Outputs
- **Trend analysis** of violent crimes over time  
- **Per capita analysis** showing firearm incident distribution  
- **Correlation visualisations** between drug offences and weapon possession  
- **Statistical evaluation** of each claim (true, false, or inconclusive)  

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated
- Cloud computing & resource provisioning  
- Distributed data processing with Spark  
- Big data transformation & filtering  
- Statistical analysis & data interpretation  
- Data visualisation & storytelling  
- Writing documented code using Jupyter Notebook  
- Critical evaluation of real-world datasets
